            Dark View Falls are two spectacular waterfalls, one above the other,
            cascading down high cliff faces and plunging into natural pools. The
            waterfalls flow all year from a tributary of the Richmond River. A
            natural Bamboo bridge spans the tumbling river, luring you to the
            two majestic falls.

        <h3>Island Trip</h3>
        <p>
          Bequia is a small island, measuring 7 square miles with a population
          of approximately 5,300. It is part of the country of Saint Vincent and
          the Grenadines. Bequia means 'island of the clouds' in the language of
          the ancient Arawak. The island's name was also 'Becouya' as part of
          the Grenadines.
          <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Princess Margaret, who had a home on nearby
          Mustique, visited Bequia in the 1950s and had a beach renamed in her
          honour.
